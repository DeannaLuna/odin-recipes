    <h2 class="whatis">What is Stargazy Pie?</h2>

    <p class="about">Stargazy pie (sometimes called starrey gazey pie, 
        stargazey pie and other variants) is a Cornish 
        dish made of baked pilchards (sardines), along 
        with eggs and potatoes, covered with a pastry crust. 
        Although there are a few variations using other 
        types of fish, the unique feature of stargazy pie is 
        fish heads (and sometimes tails) protruding through the 
        crust, so that they appear to be gazing to the stars.</p>

        <h3 class="method">Method:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a pan over a low heat, add 
                    the onion, leek and bacon and cook over a low 
                    heat until very soft but not browned.</li>
                <li>Stir in the flour to make a roux and cook for 
                    a minute. Add the white wine and fish stock, 
                    stir well to remove any lumps, bring to the boil, 
                    then turn down to a simmer and cook for 5–10 minutes 
                    until the sauce has thickened. Add the cream and bring 
                    to the boil, stirring until you have a thick sauce. Add 
                    the saffron, salt andsome pepper, stir in the parsley and 
                    fold in the chopped hard-boiled eggs.</li>
                <li>Roll out the pastry to about 3mm/⅛in thick. Cut out a 
                    long, 2cm/¾in wide strip of pastry. Dampen the rim of 
                    a deep pie dish with water and press the pastry strip 
                    onto the rim. Pour a little of the sauce into the dish 
                    and arrange the mackerel on top, with their heads on 
                    the edges of the dish. Pour over the remaining sauce.</li>
                <li>Cut out a piece of pastry a little bigger than the size 
                    of the dish, then cut slits in the pastry large enough 
                    to poke the mackerel heads through. Carefully lower 
                    onto the pie dish, then, working around the dish one 
                    fish at a time, poke the fish heads through the pastry. 
                    Brush the pastry with beaten egg and bake for 40–45 
                    minutes until the pastry is golden and crisp.</li>
